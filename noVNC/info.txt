Use the launch script to start a mini-webserver and the WebSockets proxy (websockify).
The --vnc option is used to specify the location of a running VNC server:

./utils/launch.sh --vnc localhost:5901

Point your browser to the cut-and-paste URL that is output by the launch script.
Enter a password if the VNC server has one configured. Hit the Connect button and enjoy!
